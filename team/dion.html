											<h3>About Me</h3>

											<p>I am a very open minded and energetic person. I have a lot of goals I still look forward to completing in my life. Some things I like to do with my time is be very active with sports, such as football and basketball. I also like to volunteer my time with the youth in my church and do activities with them. On a day I would like to relax, I would either play video games, watch movies, or listen to music. Although I like to relax, I really like to get out of the house and do things, so I could be productive. Being in the Year Up program really motivated me to go back and talk to the youth to help make the right choices and not get into the wrong crowd. Therefore, I like to volunteer with the youth from church or in my neighborhood, so I could let them know that there is more in life than trying to be cool or fit in. I try to utilize all my skills that I have learned so far and show them, and also will learn many things that I could work on to make myself better. That is what I want to teach the youth and make a big impact on their lives.</p>

											<p>My long term goals are slowly, but surely going to get completed. Once I graduate from the Year Up program in July, that fall semester or spring semester, I plan on using the college credits I earned and use them to get back in school to finish getting my Associates degree in Business Administration. I will then go to law school to get my Masters in Law to become a defense attorney. I plan to finish this process within the next 5 years. The short term goals I have will be earning an upcoming internship seat. I also plan to earn my certification in Microsoft Office, and become an Excel expert by the end of the program. With me earning all the certifications I feel I can merge that with law when I plan to start my own law firm, and I would really like to include the IT field in my law firm. This will be a long and difficult journey to take but I believe in myself and will complete everything that I want to achieve.</p>
