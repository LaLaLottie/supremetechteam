												<h4 id="troubleshooting" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">The Basics of Troubleshooting Theory</h4>

												<p>The basic theory of troubleshooting is a simple method that is used to quickly assess, diagnose, and find a solution to any IT related issues. Using this basic step-by-step approach would produce more accurate results in targeting the cause of a particular issue, which prevents sometimes costly inaccurate guesses.</p>

												<p style="font-weight: bold;">The Steps of Troubleshooting</p>

												<ol style="list-style-type: decimal; margin: 20px;">
													<li>
														<p style="font-weight: bold;">Identify the problem.</p>

														<p>Gather as many details as you can about the issue. This includes error messages and its main symptoms. The user can be your best source of information, so be sure to ask them questions as well. Also, determine if there has been any changes made regarding the machine. Making changes can sometimes affect the machine's configurations in various ways.</p>
													</li>

													<li>
														<p style="font-weight: bold;">Establish a theory of probable cause.</p>

														<p>Figure out what caused the problem, and what you can do to resolve the problem. Occam’s philosophy states, “We can find the simplest hypothesis, and follow the simplest one from the very beginning”. Start by asking the obvious questions first. For instance, if you can’t hear any audio, check to make sure the volume isn’t muted before replacing the speakers.</p>
													</li>

													<li>
														<p style="font-weight: bold;">Test the theory to determine a cause.</p>

														<p>Test your hypothesis to confirm if it works or not. If the hypothesis is correct, determine the next steps to resolve the problem. If the hypothesis is incorrect, reestablish a new hypothesis, or bring in an expert who is more proficient in the area that can assist you.</p>
													</li>

													<li>
														<p style="font-weight: bold;">Establish a plan of action.</p>

														<p>When creating a plan to resolve an issue, make sure that all potential effects are identified. The resolution should have minimal risk factors. This sometimes require scheduling repairs during non-production hours.</p>
													</li>

													<li>
														<p style="font-weight: bold;">Implement the plan.</p>

														<p>Execute the plan of action, and escalate the resolution as necessary.</p>

														<p style="font-style: italic;">*Note: Sometimes bringing in a third party is necessary to get the job done.</p>
													</li>

													<li>
														<p style="font-weight: bold;">Verify full system functionality.</p>

														<p>Final tests should already be included in the initial plan of action. Always have users test the finish product to confirm that it’s fully functional. Also, set in place preventative measures to ensure the same problem doesn’t occur.</p>
													</li>

													<li>
														<p style="font-weight: bold;">Document findings.</p>

														<p>Make sure everything is documented to ensure that valuable data isn’t lost, and is also retrievable. Build a knowledge base that is preferably electronic and searchable for efficiency. Keeping track of problems and resolutions could help to ensure that future issues aren’t related to a previous one as stated in the first step in the theory.</p>
													</li>

												<h4 id="customer-service" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Tech Focus: How to Interact with a Customer</h4>

												<p>I will be teaching you the importance of customer service and why customer service is needed everywhere you go.  We will also show examples of how customer service should be and how it should not be.  Customer service is the main ingredient in a successful company and to become a successful business person, and without it you will not be able to grow your business.</p>

  												<p>When you have good customer service, you and your company grow as professionals. Customers always appreciate a warm welcome when they go to buy merchandise, so giving a simple hello and a welcoming message to your customer is one of the most important things when it comes to customer service. Something that is also very important is to always be ready to answer any questions they have about your product or about you. Having answers prepared for customers makes you look very knowledgeable and it shows confidence in what you are selling and in yourself. Showing respect and giving a thank you message is also a very important message you need to show your customers.  Showing respect to your customers is a necessity because if you don't show respect to your customers then eventually you will end up with no customers at all. Finally giving a simple goodbye or thank you for their time even if they don't buy anything or don't acquire your services because you never know if they will later become your client in the future. That’s why customer service is necessary anywhere you want to pursue a career in.</p>
